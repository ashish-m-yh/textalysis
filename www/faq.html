		<p><h5>1. You analyse free text. Why would customers write detailed textual feedback?</h5></p>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
		<p>Many a time, surveys are conducted by phone calls and the feedback is recorded by a service executive, so the customer doesn't really have to write text. </p><p>Structured customer surveys often don't give a true sense of the voice of the customer. The way in which a question is framed can vastly skew the kind of response from a customer and the interpretation of the results. Technology can be effectively used to evaluate large number of textual responses, which is not otherwise possible. </p></font>

		<p><h5>2. What is the accuracy of automated analysis of text?</h5></p>
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			<p>The accuracy of analysis varies according to the data-set. However, on typical representative data-sets we have gathered and tested against, we have seen accuracy of 85-90%. Accuracy of a machine-learning/NLP system can never be 100% but we make continuous improvements to enhance the accuracy of our application. </p>
			<p>We encourage you to evaluate the system against your data-set and seek our help in bettering the accuracy of our application for your typical data, so you can sign up as a regular user.</p>

		<p><h5>3. The demo doesn’t seem to work for my data. Is the product not useful for me?</h5></p>
		<p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			Textalysis works on a pre-defined lexicon of sentiment words. Bummer you couldn’t see results for your data. Please contact us and we’ll set up a private demo for you using your dataset. <br/>
			Once you are satisfied that it works for your data, you can sign up with us.
			</font>
		</p>

		<p><h5>4. How are you different from the zillion CRM tools and survey sites on the Web?</h5></p>
		<p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			Textalysis is not a CRM application or a survey tool. These enterprise systems already collect lot of data about customers. Textalysis.ioplements these existing systems by carrying out analysis on this rich source of unstructured customer data to provide useful insights.
			</font>
		</p>

		<p><h5>5. Can I specify the watch words and phrases important to my business?</h5></p>
		<p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2"> Yes! You can edit the words that textalysis will look out for in your data and report on.</font>
		</p>
 
		<p><h5>6. What infrastructure do I need to use Textalysis?</h5></p>
		<p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			Just a computer with an Internet connection. Textalysis can be accessed from any Web Browser and works entirely on the Cloud!
			</font>
		</p>

		<p><h5>7. I am not sure if I’ll be able to understand/manage the lexicon and attributes lists to get better results from my data.</h5></p>
		<p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			Fret not. Textalysis is a relatively new kind of software product but we promise it is easy to use. We are confident our in-built support will be sufficient training for you to fully understand the product and use it effectively. We are constantly working to improve the user experience for our customers.
